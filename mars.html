     <h3>Mars Mission Success</h3> 
     <p > <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT8CG4DBLJBos5gGzn13q3DGtEm3iVtHS9e-w&s" alt=""> Mars missions are space exploration efforts to study the Red Planet, with a notable example being India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan. Launched in 2013, MOM successfully entered Mars orbit in 2014, making India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first country to succeed on its first attempt. The mission's primary goal was to demonstrate technological capabilities for interplanetary travel, but it also collected scientific data on the Martian surface and atmosphere with its onboard instruments. Other missions, like NASA's Perseverance rover, focus on searching for signs of ancient microbial life.  </p><br></section>
