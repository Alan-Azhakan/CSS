        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        <p>Founded in 2015 by a group of local journalists frustrated by the decline of comprehensive local news coverage, the Metro Chronicle was created with a single goal: to fill the void. We believe that a strong community is built on shared information, and we are committed to delivering the stories that matter most to our neighborsâ€”from city council meetings and school board decisions to the vibrant culture and community events that make our city unique.</p><br>
